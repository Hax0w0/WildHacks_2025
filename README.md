## 🚨 The Problem

Analyzing gameplay in Valorant is **slow, manual, tedious and outdated** — especially for:

- 🎯 **Semi-professional players** grinding daily  
- 🎮 **Casual players** trying to rank up  
- 🧠 Players without a coach available 24/7  

Players often sit on **hours of VODs**, which:

- Take **forever to review**  
- Lead to **missed insights or poor habits**  
- Prevent **timely adjustments** between games or scrims
